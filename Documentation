Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on various features such as behavioral traits, demographics, and medical history.

Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
imbalanced-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn

Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset from 'train.csv'.
Replaced missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features.

Model Development
Implemented various machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
XGBoost Classifier
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Balanced the training set using Random Over Sampling (ROS).
Normalized features for stable training.
Trained and evaluated each model using ROC AUC score.

Model Evaluation
Evaluated the trained models using ROC AUC score.
Visualized confusion matrix for the Logistic Regression model.

Usage
To use the trained models for prediction:
Install the required dependencies.
Load the trained model using appropriate libraries.
Preprocess input data similar to the training data.
Use the loaded model to make predictions.

Conclusion
The machine learning models achieved high ROC AUC scores, indicating good performance in predicting ASD. Further analysis and fine-tuning of hyperparameters may enhance model performance.
