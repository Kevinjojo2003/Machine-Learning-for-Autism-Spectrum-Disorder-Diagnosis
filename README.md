ASD ML Exploration: Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder through Data
Overview
This repository contains code and data for exploring machine learning techniques to aid in the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By analyzing various features and characteristics present in individuals, we aim to develop predictive models that can assist in the identification of ASD.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information collected from individuals, including demographic details, behavioral traits, and diagnostic scores. The data has been preprocessed and prepared for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conduct extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the underlying patterns within the data. Visualizations and statistical summaries are utilized to facilitate this exploration.

Preprocessing
Before building machine learning models, the data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Techniques such as label encoding, imputation, and scaling are applied to ensure the data is suitable for modeling.

Modeling
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated using the preprocessed data. Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are among the algorithms utilized in this study. Model performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score and confusion matrix analysis.

Results
The performance of each model on both training and validation datasets is reported, along with insights into their predictive capabilities. Additionally, key findings from the exploratory analysis and preprocessing stages are highlighted to provide context for the modeling results.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in assisting with the diagnosis of ASD. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we aim to contribute to the understanding and management of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
